# 🧠 Neurolab — Brain-Inspired AI Systems

Neurolab is the experimental sandbox for neuromorphic computation, low-power AI inference, and adaptive event-based perception.

**Focus areas**
- Neuromorphic coprocessors (Akida, Loihi)
- Sensor fusion kernels for low-latency vision and sound
- Bio-inspired routing and inference graphs
- On-device continual learning

**Integration Targets**
- WebKurierPhoneCore — ultra-low-latency STT
- WebKurierCore — neural event processing interface

**Current status**
- `maturity: 1` (early prototype)
- Running in sandboxed CI environment
