# QuantumLab — Quantum Navigation Experiments

**Purpose:**  
To explore quantum-inspired models for navigation, entangled signal simulation, and hybrid quantum–classical localization.

---

## Focus Areas

- Quantum Optical Processor (QOP) simulation  
- Entangled signal routing  
- Quantum-inspired optimization for navigation  
- Non-GNSS localization methods  
- Integration with VehicleHub and Fusion systems  

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Robust navigation algorithms for GNSS-denied environments  
- Simulation framework for testing hybrid quantum–classical navigation  
- Foundation for **FutureNavAgent**  

---

## CI/CD Notes

All experiments are sandboxed and isolated.  
Security layer enforced via **SAPL** (Security-Aware Promotion Layer).  
All promotions are gated by static validation and Hybrid Security telemetry.
