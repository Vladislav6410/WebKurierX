QuantumLab — Quantum Navigation Experiments
Purpose:  
To explore quantum-inspired models for navigation, entangled signal simulation, and hybrid quantum–classical localization.
Focus Areas:
•	Quantum Optical Processor (QOP) simulation
•	Entangled signal routing
•	Quantum-inspired optimization for navigation
•	Non-GNSS localization methods
•	Integration with VehicleHub and Fusion systems
Expected Outcome:
•	Robust navigation algorithms for GNSS-denied environments.
•	Simulation framework for testing hybrid quantum–classical navigation.
•	Foundation for FutureNavAgent.
CI/CD Notes: All experiments sandboxed. Security layer enforced via SAPL.quantum. Add initial QuantumLab with CI and security setup.
